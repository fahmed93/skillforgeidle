# SkillForge Idle - Project Constitution

## Project Vision
SkillForge Idle is an incremental idle game inspired by RuneScape and Melvor Idle, featuring a skill-based progression system where players train various skills from level 1 to 99.

## Core Principles

### 1. Game Design Philosophy
- **Incremental Progression**: Skills level from 1-99 with exponential XP curves
- **Idle Mechanics**: Players can progress even when not actively playing
- **Multiple Training Options**: Each skill offers 8-10 different training activities
- **Meaningful Choices**: Different training options provide varying XP rates, resource costs, and unlocks

### 2. Technical Standards
- **Platform**: React Native for cross-platform mobile (iOS/Android)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- **Performance**: Smooth 60 FPS gameplay with efficient state management
- **Testing**: Unit tests for game logic, integration tests for user flows
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

### 3. Development Approach
- **Spec-Driven**: All features start with clear specifications
- **Incremental Delivery**: Build core features first, expand gradually
- **User-Centric**: Prioritize player experience and engagement
- **Data-Driven**: Use analytics to inform balance and design decisions

### 4. Skill System Requirements
- Skills progress from level 1 to 99
- XP requirements follow exponential curve
- Each skill has 8-10 training activities
- Training activities unlock at specific skill levels
- Activities provide different XP rates and requirements

### 5. Code Standards
- TypeScript for type safety
- Functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Meaningful comments for complex logic

## Success Criteria
- Players can train multiple skills with intuitive UI
- Game state persists across sessions
- Smooth performance on mid-range mobile devices
- Engaging progression that keeps players returning
- Foundation for future feature expansion
